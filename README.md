# MachineListeningforOralHistory
These notebooks were developed for a workshop given at Digital Humanities Conference 2016(1) and revised for a workshop with London TECHNE students organised and hosted by the CRiSAP, London College of Communication, University of the Arts, London.

They were created by Alice Eldridge, Chris Kiefer, James Baker, Sharon Webb and Ben Jackson and informed by the excellent work of Steve Tjoa at http://musicinformationretrieval.com/
