    "[Python](https://python.org/) is a general-purpose programming language that is human readable, even for non-programmers and increasingly popular. You do not need to become a programmer for this workshop, but if  you want to learn more [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) is an excellent starting point.\n",
